This is a valid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is a TSA timestamp in the bundle (since there is no integrated time anymore in the entry)

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)

The log checkpoint has been replaced by a checkpoint cosigned by a witness. The signature line
is a [timestamped cosignature](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-cosignature.md).
Clients should ignore this signature line since the witness verification key is unknown. Eventually,
the witness keys will be distributed by the trust root and a client should verify this additional
signature and return the timestamp from the signature line as well.
