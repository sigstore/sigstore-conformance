An invalid bundle with dsse 0.0.2 envelope that comes from a Rekor v2 instance. It is 
generated using custom code from sigstore-java. The dsse envelope is valid in isolation
and the payload is the same as what as logged in rekor, however the signatures do not match.
The timestamp should match the signature in the embedded envelope, not the
logentry (we don't want timestamp failures). This exploits the fact that ECDSA will create
different signatures for the exact same input data.

1. Create new dsse bundle (dsse1)
2. Create another dsse bundle for the same artifact and same ECSA signing key (dsse2)
3. Replace the signature and timestamp in dsse1 with data from dsse2

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor
v2 instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)
