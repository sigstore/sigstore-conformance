Valid bundle with dsse 0.0.2 envelope that comes from a Rekor v2 instance. It is 
generated using custom code from sigstore-java.

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor
v2 instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)
