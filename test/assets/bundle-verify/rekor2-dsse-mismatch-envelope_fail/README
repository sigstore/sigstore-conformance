An invalid bundle with dsse 0.0.2 envelope that comes from a Rekor v2 instance. It is 
generated using custom code from sigstore-java. The dsse envelope is valid in isolation
but it is not the envelope that was logged to rekor.  The timestamp should match the
signature in the embedded envelope, not the logentry (we don't want timestamp failures).

1. Create new dsse bundle (dsse1)
2. Create another dsse bundle with the same key/cert but different payload (dsse2)
3. Replace the envelope and timestamp in dsse1 with data from dsse2

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor
v2 instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)
