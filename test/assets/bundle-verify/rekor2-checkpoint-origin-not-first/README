This is a valid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is a TSA timestamp in the bundle (since there is no integrated time anymore in the entry)

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)

The log checkpoint has been replaced by a checkpoint that's been cosigned, but the cosignature
is the first signature line and the log signature is the second line. Clients should ignore
the witness signature since the key is unknown, and still succeed verification since the
second signature line should be verifiable with the log public key. This test verifies
that clients do not assume that the first line of a checkpoint is always from the log.
