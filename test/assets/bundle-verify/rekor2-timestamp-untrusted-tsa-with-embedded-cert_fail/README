This is an invalid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is a TSA timestamp in the bundle (since there is no integrated time anymore in the entry) with embedded certificates from an untrusted TSA


The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trus root removed)


The TSA from which the timestamp was requested, FreeTSA, is not in the trusted root.


The timestamp was requested specifically to include embedded certificates.
