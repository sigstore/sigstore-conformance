This is an invalid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is a TSA timestamp in the bundle (since there is no integrated time anymore in the entry)
* The identity of the checkpoint signature does not match the transparency log host

Test creation: In a Rekor v2 happy path bundle, the phrase "sigstage" in the identity of the checkpoint signature was replaced with "github."

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trus root removed)
