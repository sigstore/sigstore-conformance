An invalid bundle with dsse 0.0.2 envelope that comes from a Rekor v2 instance. It is 
generated using custom code from sigstore-java. The signature is not valid for the dsse
envelope, but the timestamp should match the signature (we don't want timestamp failures)

1. Create new dsse bundle (dsse1)
2. Create another unrelated dsse bundle for the same artifact (dsse2)
3. Replace the signature and timestamp in dsse1 with data from dsse2

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor
v2 instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)
