This is a valid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is a TSA timestamp in the bundle (since there is no integrated time anymore in the entry) with an expired certificate chain


A locally hosted instance of the Sigstore TSA was modified such that the certificate chain's expiry date was five minutes after startup. A timestamp was requested within that short window. As of the time this test is run, the certificate chain will have expired.


The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trus root removed)


The trusted root is modified to include the locally hosted TSA.
