This is a valid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is a TSA timestamp in the bundle (since there is no integrated time anymore in the entry)


The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trust root removed)

The log checkpoint has had its origin line removed, which should cause a parsing failure.
